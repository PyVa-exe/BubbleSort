# BubbleSort 

This is a program, to sort arrays with the BubbleSort Algorithm. The Algorithm is very slow and inefficient, but it is the easiest sorting Algithm to implement. I have written this Program in Baabnq and in C, so if you dont understand baabnq, you can look at the C code and understand it. If you want to find out more about Sorting Algorithms and BubbleSort then those articles are the best for you.

You can use this code in your programs if you are too lazy to write the Algorithm yourself.
